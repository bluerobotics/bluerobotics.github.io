# Introduction

The _Electronics Tray_ is a convenient new way to mount your underwater electronics in a 4" watertight enclosure. We designed this tray to make installing and working on your electronics as easy as possible. The _Electronics Tray_ mounts to a 4" Watertight Enclosure O-ring Flange, so you don't need any tools to access your electronics.

## Installing the Terminal Blocks

The _Electronics Tray_ optionally comes with 2 8-Circuit Barrier Blocks and 2 9-Circuit Eurostyle Terminal Strips, along with their mounting hardware. Below are instructions on how to attach them. Please note that if you are planning on installing [Basic ESCs](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/speed-controllers/besc-30-r1/), it is easier to install them prior to installing the Barrier/Terminal Blocks. The rest of the electronics that the _Electronics Tray_ is designed for can be mounted easily after the terminal blocks have been installed. 

1. Attach the jumpers to the Black Screw Terminal Block if necessary for your application.


2. Install the 8-Circuit Barrier Blocks onto the main tray.

3. Install the standoffs and 9-Circuit Eurostyle Terminal Strip on top of the standoffs.
