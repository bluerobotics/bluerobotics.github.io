## Install Newton Gripper Penetrator

To install the Newton Gripper into the end cap, you will need the following parts and tools:

- 1 x Newton Gripper assembly
- 1 x Penetrator Nut (Red)
- 1 x Penetrator O-ring
- 1 x Silicone Grease – 10g Tube
- 1 x Isopropyl Alcohol Wipe
- 1 x Penetrator wrench

1.	Wipe the exterior surface of the electronics enclosure endcap clean with isopropyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol wipes, and make sure it is free of any particles in the areas where the penetrator O-ring will sit.
2.	Remove the O-ring from the bag and apply silicone grease to it.
<img src="/newton-gripper/cad/grease-o-ring.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />
3.	Install the O-ring onto the Gripper cable penetrator.
4.  Install the Gripper cable penetrator on to the end cap in the hole you previously removed the blank penetrator from. Tighten to finger tight, then use the provided wrench to tighten it an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can’t loosen it with your fingers, it is tight enough.

## Reassemble BlueROV2 Electronics Enclosure

To reassemble your BlueROV2 electronics Enclosure, you will need the following parts and tools:

-	4 x M3x16 screws that were placed off to the side during disassembly
-	1 x Silicone Grease – 10g Tube
-	1 x 2.5 mm hex driver

1.	Reinstall 4” Watertight Enclosure onto ROV with the following steps:
    - Apply silicone grease to the two radial O-rings on the O-Ring Flange (4” Series) that is attached to the Electronics Tray then install the Watertight Enclosure (4” Series) with installed Dome End Cap to the O-Ring Flange (4” Series).
    - Mount the Electronics Enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels without the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series). It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series). This allows to clips to rotate so you can find the threaded hole in the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series) easily.

<img src="/newton-gripper/cad/gripper-tutorial-attach.JPG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Cable Management

To clean up the external Newton Gripper cable, you will need the bag of 5 zip ties and your scissors/wire cutters.

The primary goal of cable management is to prevent the wires from getting cut by the propellers. Make sure to check that no wires can reach the propellers after you have finished routing the Newton Gripper cable. Below is an example of what the cable routing should look like.

<img src="/newton-gripper/cad/gripper-tutorial-cable-routing.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Reinstall Buoyancy Blocks and Fairings

To install the new buoyancy blocks and fairings, you will need the following parts and tools:

-	16 x Fairing screws that were placed off to the side during disassembly
-	4 x Fairings with buoyancy installed that were placed off to the side during disassembly
-	1 x #1 Phillips head screwdriver

1.	 Reinstall Original Fairing Blocks onto ROV by installing the screws through the center panels and into the fairings.
<img src="/newton-gripper/cad/gripper-tutorial-2.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Adjusting Ballast on the Frame

To adjust the amount or position of ballast on the frame you need the following parts and tools:

- 7 x 200g Ballast weights (from original BlueROV2 Kit)
- 10 x 8-16 Thread, 5/8” Long, Thread-Forming Screws
- 1 x #2 Phillips head screwdriver

To get the longest battery life and the best driving experience, it is important to have the ROV close to balanced from front to back in water and close to neutrally buoyant. The Newton Gripper adds a bit of weight to the ROV, so it will need to be retrimmed based on your operating conditions. Trimming the ballast may involve a bit of trial and error.

## Setup in QGroundControl

The following servo settings are available on ArduSub 3.5.3 and QGroundControl v3.2.4-BlueRobotics-Rev6 or newer. If your software is out of date, please conduct a software update by following the instructions on the [BlueROV2 Software Setup](http://docs.bluerobotics.com/brov2/software-setup/) page. 

The _Newton Gripper_ can be controlled via the following button functions:

- *servo_X_max_momentary* (open while pressed)
- *servo_X_min_momentary* (close while pressed)

where *X* is the Aux Channel to which the gripper is connected.  For example, a _Newton Gripper_ plugged into Aux Channel 3 can be opened and closed with the *servo_3_max_momentary* and *servo_3_min_momentary* button functions, respectively.

<img src="/newton-gripper/cad/jsbutton-selection.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw fa-2x blue"></i>
Note that these button functions only exist for Aux Channels 1~3.  Should your _Newton Gripper_ be connected to any other output channel, you will be unable to control it with joystick buttons.

<img src="/newton-gripper/cad/joystick-gripper.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

You may set-up your controller buttons however you like, however the limited number of buttons means that you will have to shift the button controls around. Our preference is to assign the Gripper open and close functions to the bumper buttons so the operator still has full movement control on the joysticks. We then moved the camera tilt to being on Shift->Bumper button pushes as illustrated below in the button assignment table for a Logitech F310.

| Button | Function              | Shift Function  |
|:------:|:---------------------:|:---------------:|

| 10     | **servo_3_max_momentary** | **mount_tilt_up**   |
| 11     | gain_inc              | trim_pitch_dec  |
| 12     | gain_dec              | trim_pitch_inc  |
| 13     | lights1_dimmer        | trim_roll_dec   |

| 15     | Disabled              | Disabled        |

# Final Test

That's it! Once powered up you should be able to control the gripper with the joystick buttons. The ROV *does not* need to be armed for the gripper to be active.
