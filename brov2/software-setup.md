# Software Intro

These are instructions for the first time that you set up your computer to work with the BlueROV2. If you have not assembled your BlueROV2, please see our [Assembly Manual](/brov2/assembly/) and assemble your BlueROV2 prior to setting up the software. If you received your BlueROV2 prior to October 24, 2016 proceed to [ArduSub.com](http://ardusub.com/initial-setup/#install-qgroundcontrol) for software setup information. The **PixHawks** that shipped **prior to October 24, 2016** were **not flashed with firmware** and require some **QGroundControl parameters to be changed**. 

# Install QGroundControl

To connect your computer to the BlueROV2, you need to **download the most recent daily build of QGroundControl.**

Here are the direct links to the most recent daily builds:

- [Windows](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qgroundcontrol/builds/master/QGroundControl-installer.exe)
- [Mac OSX](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qgroundcontrol/builds/master/QGroundControl.dmg)
- Linux
	- [AppImage](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qgroundcontrol/builds/master/QGroundControl.AppImage)
	- [Compressed Archive](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qgroundcontrol/builds/master/QGroundControl.tar.bz2)

# Setting Up Your Computer

If your computer does not have an Ethernet port, you will need a USB to Ethernet adaptor. We recommend using [this one.](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Ethernet-Network-Adapter/dp/B00ET4KHJ2)

## Windows Setup

**Network Settings**

1. Go to _Control Panel_ > _Network and Sharing Center_ and then choose "Change adapter settings".

	<img src="/brov2/cad/network-and-sharing-center-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

2. Right click on the Ethernet adapter, then choose _Properties_.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/network-connections-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

3. In the properties dialog, choose _Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)_, then click _Properties_.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/internet-protocol-version-4-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

4. Select "Use the following IP address" And enter 192.168.2.1 for the IP address and 255.255.255.0 for the Subnet mask. Then select OK.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/static-ip-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

## Linux Setup

**Network Settings**

1. Click the Network Icon in the toolbar at the top of the screen, and click "Edit Connections..."

	<img src="/brov2/cad/linuxsetup/LinuxStep1.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

2. Click "Add"

	<img src="/brov2/cad/linuxsetup/LinuxStep2.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

3. Select "Ethernet" for the connection type and click "Create..."

	<img src="/brov2/cad/linuxsetup/LinuxStep3.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

4. From the "Device MAC Address" dropdown, select the ethernet interface you want to use. If you are using the built in ethernet card on your computer, there will be only one choice. If you are using a USB to Ethernet adapter, find out which interface corresponds to the adapter by looking at the options before and after plugging the adapter into the computer.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/linuxsetup/LinuxStep4.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

5. Click the "IPv4 Settings" tab, and from the "Method" dropdown menu, select "Manual". Click "Add", and enter 192.168.2.1 for the Address, 255.255.255.0 for the Netmask and 0.0.0.0 for the Gateway. Click "Save..." to complete the setup.

# Joystick/Gamepad Calibration

The first time you use a new joystick or gamepad in QGroundControl, you will be asked to calibrate it. This allows QGroundControl to detect which axis is which and what the range of each axis is.

**Important Note:** The Calibration process is a little confusing. This will be fixed in upcoming versions of QGroundControl, but for now, you must follow this process.

1. Click "Calibrate" on the joystick page, then click "Next".
 
2. **We want to calibrate the joysticks in the opposite way that QGroundControl asks us to.** When asked to move each axis, move the following sticks:

	- Throttle: Right stick up/down
	- Yaw: Right stick right/left
	- Roll: Left stick right/left
	- Pitch: Left stick up/down

# Button Setup

The default button setup for the BlueROV2 is as shown in the image below:

<img src="/brov2/cad/controller-buttons.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

# Sensor Calibration

1. Go to the settings tab in QGroundControl and select the red _Sensors_ tab on the left sidebar.
2. Choose your autopilot orientation:
	- `Roll90` for the BlueROV2
3. Click on the _Accelerometers_ and follow the instructions.
4. Click on _Compass_ and follow the instructions.

When completed, the _Sensors_ tab will no longer be red.

# Configure Motor Directions

The motor directions for the BlueROV2 must be tested prior to use. 

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>Be sure to keep all body parts and clothing clear of thrusters while the BlueROV2 is armed.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>**Do not** run thrusters for longer than 30 seconds in air.

1. Set the flight mode to "Manual".

2. Arm the BlueROV2 by pressing "Start"

3. Move the left joystick forwards and verify that the thrusters are running the correct way. Air should be blowing out of the four vectored thrusters towards the back of the vehicle. If one of the thrusters is blowing air towards the front, go to _Settings_ in QGroundContorl, then go to _Parameters_ and select _MOT_. Select the motor that is blowing air towards the front and switch the motor direction using the dropdown on the right.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/configure-motor-directions-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

4. Move the right joystick forwards and verify that the thrusters are running the correct way. Air should be blowing out of the two vertical thrusters towards the bottom of the vehicle. If one of the thrusters is blowing air towards the top, go to _Settings_ in QGroundControl, then go to _Parameters_ and select _MOT_. Select the motor that is blowing air towards the top and switch the motor direction using the dropdown on the right.

# Voltage and Current Measurement Setup 

The default settings for voltage and current measurement are for the [Multistar High Capacity 4s 10,000mAh](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=56844) battery that we recommend. If you select a different battery, you can adjust your voltage and current measurement setup by going to _Settings_ then select _Power_. The only thing that you will need to change is the "Battery capacity", which can changed by simply typing in the size of the battery into the box.

# SOS Leak Sensor Setup

In the Safety tab, select "Pixhawk Aux6" as the leak detector pin, and set the Logic when dry to "Low."
