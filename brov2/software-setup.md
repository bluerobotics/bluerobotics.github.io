# Install QGroundControl

To connect your computer to the BlueROV2, you need to download and install QGroundControl:

- [Windows](https://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.bluerobotics.com/QGC/QGroundControl-installer.exe)

# Network Setup

If your computer does not have an Ethernet port, you will need a USB to Ethernet adaptor. We recommend using [this one.](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Ethernet-Network-Adapter/dp/B00ET4KHJ2)

**Network Settings**

1. Go to _Control Panel_ > _Network and Sharing Center_ and then choose "Change adapter settings".

	<img src="/brov2/cad/network-and-sharing-center-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

2. Right click on the Ethernet adapter, then choose _Properties_.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/network-connections-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

3. In the properties dialog, choose _Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)_, then click _Properties_.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/internet-protocol-version-4-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

4. Select "Use the following IP address" And enter 192.168.2.1 for the IP address and 255.255.255.0 for the Subnet mask. Then select OK.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/static-ip-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

**Firewall**

1. Go to _Control Panel_ > _Windows Firewall_ and then select "Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall".

2. Select "Change Settings" and then select "Open source ground control app provided by QGroundControl dev team" or "QGroundControl".

	<img src="/brov2/cad/windows-firewall-annotated.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

# Joystick Setup

**Initial Setup for XBox Controllers on Windows**

For using the shift button functionality of XBox Controllers on Windows:

1. Go to Start -> Settings

# Update Software

There are two computers installed on the BlueROV2: a Pixhawk autopilot, and a Raspberry Pi 'companion' computer. Before proceeding, we will check that the software on both computers is up to date, and update the software if necessary.

## Companion

Companion is the software that runs on the Raspberry Pi. To perform a companion software update:

- Plug a _fully charged_ battery into the ROV and connect the tether to your computer.
- Navigate to [192.168.2.2:2770/network](http://192.168.2.2:2770/network) in your browser and ensure that the ROV has access to a WiFi network. If you do not see a webpage at this address, you need to perform the update according to the instructions [here](http://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/software-updates/1128).
- Navigate to [192.168.2.2:2770/system](http://192.168.2.2:2770/system). Click the button that says 'Update companion'. If you do not see this button, then the companion software is up to date.
- The update process will take between 5 and 20 minutes depending on the Internet connection speed. Wait for the update process to complete.
- When it completes, refresh your browser. The companion version should be updated, and the update available message should no longer appear.
- If the update fails (usually due to a loss of internet connectivity), you will be warned that the ROV will reboot and to leave the battery plugged in. At this point, once you are able to refresh the webpage, it is safe to either power down the ROV or attempt the update again.

## ArduSub

ArduSub is the software that runs on the Pixhawk autopilot. To perform an ArduSub software update:

- Navigate to [192.168.2.2:2770/network](http://192.168.2.2:2770/network) and ensure that the ROV has an internet connection
- Navigate to [192.168.2.2:2770/system](http://192.168.2.2:2770/system). Click the button under the 'Pixhawk Firmware Update' section that says 'Stable'.
- Wait for the update process to complete, and you are finished!


# Joystick/Gamepad Calibration

Some joysticks require calibration before you can enable them for use with QGroundControl. If your joystick requires calibration, the *Joystick* tab on the *Vehicle Settings* page will be red, and you should follow these steps to calibrate your joystick. If your joystick does not require calibration, the *Joystick* tab will not be red, and you can skip this step!

1. Go to the *Vehicle Settings* page in QGroundControl, then click on the red *Joystick* tab in the sidebar on the left.

2. Ensure the 'TX Mode' selection is set to 3.

3. Click "Calibrate", then click "Next".
 
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions, move the sticks as indicated in the diagram in QGroundControl.

When completed, the *Joystick* tab will no longer be red, and the *Enabled* checkbox on the Joystick page should be checked.

# Button Setup

The default button setup for the BlueROV2 is as shown in the image below:

<img src="/brov2/cad/joystick-defaults.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

The button functions may be reconfigured in the *Joystick* tab on the *Vehicle Settings* page.

# Sensor Calibration

1. Go to the *Vehicle Settings* page in QGroundControl and select the red _Sensors_ tab in the sidebar on the left.
2. Choose `Roll90` for the *Autopilot Orientation* selection.
3. Click on the _Accelerometers_ and follow the instructions.
4. Click on _Compass_ and follow the instructions.

When completed, the _Sensors_ tab will no longer be red.

# Configure Motor Directions

The motor directions for the BlueROV2 must be configured prior to operation.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>Be sure to keep all body parts and clothing clear of thrusters while the BlueROV2 is armed.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>**Do not** run thrusters for longer than 30 seconds in air.

1. Go to the *Vehicle Settings* page in QGroundControl and select the _Motors_ tab in the sidebar on the left.
1. Read and understand the instructions on the setup page
1. Arm the BlueROV2 by clicking the switch on the page
1. One at a time, move each slider, and make sure that the motor that spins is pushing air in the correct direction. If a motor is spinning in the wrong direction, click the corresponding checkbox under the 'Reverse Motor Direction' section to correct the motor rotation.
1. When you are finished with the setup, disarm the ROV by clicking the switch

    <img src="/brov2/cad/qgc-motor-setup.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

# Voltage and Current Measurement Setup 

The default settings for voltage and current measurement are for the [Multistar High Capacity 4s 10,000mAh](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=56844) battery that we recommend. If you select a different battery, you can adjust your voltage and current measurement setup by going to _Settings_ then select _Power_. The only thing that you will need to change is the "Battery capacity", which can changed by simply typing in the size of the battery into the box.

<img src="/brov2/cad/current-monitoring-setup.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

# SOS Leak Sensor Setup

In the Safety tab, select "Pixhawk Aux6" as the leak detector pin, and set the Logic when dry to "Low."
