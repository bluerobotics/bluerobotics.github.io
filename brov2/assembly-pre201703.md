	<img src="/brov2/cad/etray-disassemble.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

## Connecting the ESC Power and Motor Wires

To connect the ESC power and motor wires, you need the following parts and tools

- 1.5 mm allen hex key
- 2.5 or 3 mm flat head screw driver
- Phillips head screw driver
- Electronics tray
- Tweezers

Here is a diagram of where the ESC power wires should go for the port and starboard side. The camera is mounted on the port side.

<img src="/brov2/cad/connecting-esc-power-starboard.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

<img src="/brov2/cad/connecting-esc-power-port.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

1. Step 1 is optional, but it definitely makes installing the power wires easier. Use the 1.5 mm hex key to remove the motor terminal blocks on both sides. 

	<img src="/brov2/cad/brov2-euro-terminal-removal.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

2. Pass the ESC signal wires from the port side to the starboard side through the holes by the power terminal block. This will help with cable routing later.

3. Feed all black ESC power wires to the port side using the holes near the power terminal block and feed all red ESC power wires through to the starboard side. Connect the power wires to their terminal blocks. Make sure to keep the outer screw terminals open, the power wires will get connected there later. Using tweezers can help with wire routing and pushing the spades into the screw terminals.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/brov2-esc-signal-wire-routing.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

4. If you did step 1, reinstall the motor terminal blocks using the 1.5 mm hex key

	<img src="/brov2/cad/brov2-bullet-to-xt90.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

## Optional Preliminary Vacuum Test

This is the best point in the assembly process to perform a vacuum test. Since you have installed all of the penetrators, but have not done any of the wiring, troubleshooting will be as easy as possible. To prepare for the vacuum test you need to purchase a vacuum pump. We recommend [this one](https://www.amazon.com/HFS-Brake-Bleeder-Vacuum-Tuner/dp/B00NP60URE/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1470775016&sr=8-10&keywords=vacuum+pump).

1. Install the 4 hole 3 inch end cap onto the battery enclosure.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/3-inch-end-cap-installed.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px">

2. Install the electronics enclosure onto the 14 hole 4 inch end cap.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/4-inch-end-cap-installed.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px">

3. Assemble the vacuum tee.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/vacuum-tee-assembled.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px">

Now you are ready to perform the preliminary vacuum test.

1. Test your vacuum pump to ensure that it is not leaking. See our [Testing the Test Setup Tutorial](http://docs.bluerobotics.com/tutorials/vacuum-test-plug/#testing-the-test-setup) for detailed information. 

2. Insert one of the vacuum plugs into the battery enclosure.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/vent-on-3-inch-end-cap.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px">

3. Insert the other vacuum plug into the electronics enclosure.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/vent-on-4-inch-end-cap.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px">

4. Pump the vacuum until the gauge reads 10 in. Hg [34 kPa] vacuum.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/vacuum-10-inches.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px">

5. Let the BlueROV2 and pump sit for 15 minutes.

6. If the gauge reads above 9 in. Hg [31 kPa] after 15 minutes, your seals are acceptable.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/vacuum-9-inches.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px">

If the gauge reads below 9 in. Hg [31 kPa] vacuum after 15 minutes, you should check the following:

1. Make sure that the M3 screws on the front and back end caps of the battery and electronics enclosure using the M2.5 hex driver. If you are able to tighten one or more, attempt the vacuum test again.

2. Make sure that the penetrators on the battery and electronics enclosure are fully tightened. Check by attempting to loosen by hand. If you are able to tighten one or more, attempt the vacuum test again.

3. Make sure that all of the O-rings are installed in the penetrators. If any are missing, install then attempt the vacuum test again.

4. Check that the face seal O-rings and radial O-rings are installed in the battery and electronics enclosures and in good condition. If you find a damaged or missing O-ring, install and attempt the vacuum test again.

If you are still having trouble holding vacuum, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bluerobotics.com">support@bluerobotics.com</a>

To continue assembling the BlueROV2, remove the acrylic tube and dome from the electronics enclosure.

## Installing the SOS Leak Sensor

To install the <em>SOS</em> Leak Sensor you will need the following parts and tools:

- Scissors
- Isopropyl alcohol
- Cleaning cloth/cotton swab

1. Cut to size and use the included double sided foam tape to secure the <em>SOS</em> Leak Sensor board in a convenient location on your BlueROV2 electronics tray. We like to put it behind the tether interface board or Pixhawk. 

	<img src="/sos/cad/sos-layout.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px"  />

2. Connect the 3 pin extension cable to the <em>SOS</em> Leak Sensor board and Pixhawk port AUX OUT 6, taking care to plug the cable in the right orientation with ground (black) facing the Pixhawk top.

	<img src="/sos/cad/board-placement.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px"  />

3. Prep mounting surfaces with some isopropyl alcohol, then peel off the backing and stick the blue SOS Leak Sensor probes in strategic locations (like the penentrators, flange seals, etc.) throughout your BlueROV2 electronics watertight enclosure, or secure them with a small zip tie.  Be sure to place at least one probe at the bottom of the watertight enclosure, where leaking water is likely to collect. Plug the white JST-GH ends of the probes into the SOS Leak Sensor board in any combination.

# Final Assembly

## Mounting the Electronics Enclosure onto the Frame

To mount the electronics enclosure to the frame you need the following parts and tools:

- 4" WTE with dome installed
- Thread-locker
- Bag with 4 M3x16 screws
- 2.5 mm hex driver

1. Remove the vent plug from the vent penetrator.

2. Reapply silicone grease to the O-rings at the back of the electronics tray, then reinstall tube with dome over the electronics tray.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/installed-etray-empty-frame.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

3. Apply one drop of thread-locker to each of the 4 M3x16 screws.

4. Mount the electronics enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels _without_ the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the cradles. It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the cradles. This allows to clips to rotate so you can find the cradle hole easily. 

	<img src="/brov2/cad/clip-installation.PNG" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />

## Mounting the Thrusters to the Frame

To mount the thrusters to the frame, you need the following parts and tools:

- 2.5 mm hex driver
- 6 T200 thrusters
- Bag with 16 M3x16 screws and 8 M3x12 screws in smaller bag
- The ROV frame

Here is a diagram of where the thrusters go, and how they should be oriented. The green thrusters should have counter-clockwise propellers and blue thrusters should have clockwise propellers. The order of installation matters here. You cannot get the front thrusters on if the rear ones were installed first.

<p align="center">
<img src="http://ardusub.com/images/vectored-frame.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:900px" />
</p>

1. Install thrusters 1 and 2, using the M3x16 screws. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly. It is physically possible to keep turning the screw at this point, but it isn't necessary.
	
2. Install thrusters 5 and 6, using the M3x12 screws. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.

3. Install thrusters 3 and 4, using the M3x16 screws. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.
