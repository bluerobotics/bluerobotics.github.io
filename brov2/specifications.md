# Introduction

The _BlueROV2_ is the world's most affordable high-performance ROV. The 6-thruster vectored configuration, coupled with strong static stability, provides a vehicle that is smooth and stable, yet highly maneuverable. The _BlueROV2_ provides the capabilities of a 
high-end commercial mini-ROV at the price of the most basic commercial ROVs.

## Features

- Live Ultra-low Latency Video (with Standard Electronics Package)
- Live 1080p HD Video (with Advanced Electronics Package, 200 ms latency)
- Highly Maneuverable Vectored Thruster Configuration
- Stable and Optimized for Inspection- and Research-class Missions
- Easy to Use, Cross-platform User Interface
- Highly Expandable with Three Free Cable Penetrators
- Standard 100m Depth Rating and Up to 300m Tether Available
- 6 T200 Thrusters and Basic ESCs for the Best Thrust-to-Weight Ratio in its Class
- Battery powered With Quick-Swappable Batteries for Long Missions

## What's Included

The kit arrives almost-ready-to-dive with pre-built subassemblies. The expected build time is 4-8 hours to operation depending on experience.

Here is the [Bill of Material](/brov2/assembly/#whats-included) for the each _BlueROV2_ kit.

The Standard and Advanced options have a couple of differences shown [here](/brov2/#standard-and-advanced-comparison)

## What's Not Included

There are some items necessary for operation that are not included with the kit. 

 - Analog screen for the Standard _BlueROV2_. We recommend [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2261).
 - A gamepad controller. We recommend [this XBox360 Controller](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/controllers/wired-controller) or [this Logitech Gamepad](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/f310-gamepad).
 - A laptop or a tablet. ArduSub works on Mac, Linux, Windows, iOS, and Android devices.
 - A LiPo battery. We recommend getting two or three of [these](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=56844)
