# Introduction

The _BlueROV2_ is the world's most affordable high-performance ROV. The 6-thruster vectored configuration, coupled with strong static stability, provides a vehicle that is smooth and stable, yet highly maneuverable. The _BlueROV2_ provides the capabilities of a 
high-end commercial mini-ROV at the price of the most basic commercial ROVs.

## What's Included

The kit arrives almost-ready-to-dive with pre-built subassemblies. The expected build time is 1.5-3 hours to operation depending on experience.

Here is the [Bill of Materials](/brov2/assembly/#whats-included) for the _BlueROV2_ kit.

## What's Not Included

There are some items necessary for operation that are not included with the kit. 

 - A gamepad controller. We recommend [this XBox One Controller](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/xbox-wireless-controller/8vcw8gln9vrf/ljvk?cid=msft_web_collection&activetab=pivot%3atechspecstab) or [this Logitech Gamepad](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/f310-gamepad).
 - A laptop or a Windows 10 tablet. QGroundControl works on Mac, Windows 10, and Linux.
 - A battery for the BlueROV2. We recommend getting our [18Ah Lithium-ion Battery](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/battery-li-4s-18ah-r2-rp/) or 2 or 3 of [these](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=56844)
 - A battery charger, such as our [Lithium Battery Charger](http://www.bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/batteries/lithium-battery-charger/).

# 3D Model

These are BIG files since the model is fairly complex. If you just want to check out a 3D view or 3D models of the BlueROV, we recommend [checking out the CAD files on GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/bluerov2-1).

# User Manuals

1. Please look at our [Assembly Manual](/brov2/assembly) for more detailed assembly instructions.

2. If you **received your BlueROV2 after October 24, 2016**, please look at our [Software Setup Manual](/brov2/software-setup/) for more details on setting up your topside computer. If you **received your BlueROV2 prior to October 24, 2016** please look at our [ArduSub Documentation](http://ardusub.com/introduction/#overview) for more details on the control software.

3. Please look at our [_BlueROV2_ Operating Manual](/brov2/operation) for a detailed operating manual.
