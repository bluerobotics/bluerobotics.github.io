#Introduction

Our cable penetrators make waterproof, high-pressure seals to pass the thruster cables into a water-tight enclosure. Each set includes a bolt, nut, and O-ring. We offer cable penetrators with a hole for the thruster cable and also with no hole.

#Installation

This tutorial should help make the Cable Penetrator Installation simple!

**Safety**

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> When working with tools, always use caution. This tutorial is provided as guidance and should be followed at your own risk.

**Tools You Need**

* Super Glue
* [Marine Epoxy](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/tools/loctite-marine-epoxy/)
* Isopropyl alcohol for cleaning

##Step 1: Stripping the Jacket

To strip the wire jacket, please follow the [Cable Jacket Stripping Tutorial](/tutorials/cable-stripping/).

##Step 2: Cleaning Surfaces

Start by cleaning all surfaces that will be in contact with epoxy with isopropyl alcohol. This will ensure a good bond. Clean the inside of the penetrator and the end of the cable. Let it dry for a few minutes before continuing.

##Step 3: Attaching the Penetrator

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-1.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />
Twist the conductors so they will slide through the penetrator.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-2.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />
Apply a small amount of super glue to the edge of the cable jacket. Optionally, you can apply "CA kicker" inside the penetrator so that the glue will dry quickly.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-3.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />
Insert the cable into the penetrator, allowing the super glue to set.  

##Step 4: Sealing the Penetrator

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-4.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />
Mix the epoxy and fill the syringe.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-6.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />
Fill the penetrator hole with the epoxy. Move the cable from side to side within the hole to ensure the epoxy is filling any gaps. Use a vice or other method to hold the penetrator upright while the epoxy cures.

After the epoxy dries, apply the same method to the other side of the penetrator. 

##Step 5: Lubricating the O-ring

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-six.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

Use a small amount of silicone grease to lubricate the O-ring and place it in the groove of the penetrator. 

##Step 6: Installation

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-five.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

Install each penetrator into the end cap ighten each penetrator by hand or using a wrench.




#Notes

* If using a cable with smaller diameter, you can add layers of heat shrink tubing to increase diameter for a snug fit in the cable penetrator.
