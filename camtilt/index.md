# Introduction

The _Camera Tilt System_ is a tilting camera mount which works seamlessly with the [Watertight Enclosure for ROV/AUV (4" Series)](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/watertight-enclosures/wte4-asm-r1/) and the [Electronics Tray (4" Series)](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/watertight-enclosures/4-series/electronics-tray-2). The tilting servo is the high-quality digital HS-5055MG servo with metal gears. The camera mounts are compatible with our [Raspberry Pi Camera w/ Wide Angle Lens](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/cam-rpi-wide-r1/) and our [Low-Light Analog Camera](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/low-light-ntsc-camera/). We have also made the 3D CAD files freely available so that you can modify them to fit your camera or servo!

# Assembly

## Required tools

- \#000 Phillips Screwdriver (or similar small size)
- 1.5 mm Hex Driver
- Wire Cutters

## Raspberry Pi Camera

1. Attach the servo mount to the front tray of the _Electronics Tray_ using 2 of the M2x8 screws.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/servo-mount-attached.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

2. Open the servo box and remove the servo arm that comes installed on the servo using a #000 Philips screwdriver. Place the screw that held on that servo arm in a safe place.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/servo-arm-removal.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

3. Install the servo on the servo mount using 2 of the M2x8 screws. 

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/servo-installed-empty.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />
	
4. Install the servo arm onto the servo 
	
	a. Grab the servo arm shown below from the bag that came in the servo box.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/servo-arm.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

	b. Trim off the ends of the servo arm so that only one screw hole remains on both sides.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/servo-arm-cut.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

	c. Place the servo arm back on the servo horizontally and then rotate it as far clockwise as possible.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/servo-arm-install.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

	d. If the servo arm is now approximately vertical, reinstall the servo arm screw. If it is not vertical, remove it and place it as near vertical as possible then reinstall the servo arm screw.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/servo-arm-cut-installed.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

5. Install the camera mount onto the servo arm using the self-tapping screws that came in the servo box. Keep the servo arm in the vertical position from the last step and have the orientation match the picture below.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/pi-cam-mount-installed.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

6. Trim the threads that stick out of the back of the camera mount. Be sure to wear safety glasses. Trim the top screw first then rotate the mount so the bottom screw is on top, then trim the second screw.

	<img src="/camtilt/cad/annotated-pi-cam-cutting-screws.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

7. Attach the camera to the camera mount using M2x8 screws.

# Example Code

## Arduino

This example uses the Arduino Servo library to control the servo. This provides an update rate of 50 Hz and can use any pin on the Arduino board as the "servoPin".

If you've never used Arduino before, we suggest checking out [some tutorials!](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage)

~~~~~~~~~~ cpp
#include <Servo.h>

byte servoPin = 9;
Servo servo;

void setup() {
  servo.attach(servoPin);

  servo.writeMicroseconds(1500); // send "neutral" signal to the servo
}

void loop() {
  int signal = 1700; // Set signal value, which should be between 1100 and 1900

  servo.writeMicroseconds(signal); // Send signal to the servo
}
