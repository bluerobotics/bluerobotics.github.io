#Under Pressure Software

Under Pressure 4.60 is a software package graciously released by [DeepSea Power & Light](http://www.deepsea.com/) for free use. It's made for designing water tight enclosures and can calculate the performance of tubes, end-caps, domes, and spheres of any material.

Keep in mind that the software is accurate under ideal, theoretical conditions. In the real world you have to leave some margin for variations in materials, dimensions, and just about everything. That said, Under Pressure is a fantastic tool for design!

The original software only runs on Windows but we've made a special ["Wine Bottled"](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/) version of it that runs great on Macs as well!
