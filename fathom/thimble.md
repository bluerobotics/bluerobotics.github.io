# Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to install the Fathom tether onto the [Thimble](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/parts/fathom-p-thimble-r1/), providing a high-strength way to attach the tether to your ROV frame.
	
# Installation

1. Grab the tether somewhere between about 16 and 24 inches away from the penetrator and loop it around a [plastic thimble.](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/parts/fathom-p-thimble-r1/)

2. Firmly attach three alternating heavy gauge zip ties (included with thimble) at the base of the thimble.
