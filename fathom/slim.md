# Introduction

The Fathom Slim Tether is a high quality tether cable designed specifically for ROVs and other subsea applications. It is neutrally buoyant, has 300+ lb breaking strength, and is embedded with water-blocking fibers to seal any leaks. The tether has a diameter of 4.0mm and is much slimmer than the vast majority of comparable ROV tethers.

This tether is ideal for travel, deep dives, and long distance dives where size and drag are paramount.
 
# Quick Start 

1. Prepare the ends of your tether for use as shown in the installation tutorial [Coming soon].

2. Be sure to tin the ends of the conductors prior to installing the tether into your vehicle.

3. Firmly attach the tether to your vehicle by following the strain relief tutorial [Coming soon] or some other method that prevents the tether from pulling directly on the tether penetrator. The tether can twist the penetrator loose if you do not provide strain relief.
